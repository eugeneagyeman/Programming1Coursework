Welcome to the smartHouse simulator.
To ÅŸet up a simulation:

1.Move the configuration file to the folder containing the classes.
2.Redirect  terminal to the the extension folder (not inside the folder)
3. Compile all classes using javac *.java
4. Once compiled, run the following command

Java House myHouse.txt followed by the maximum amount of hours you would like the simulation to run for.

Example

java House myHouse.txt 2000

'myHouse.txt' is the file meant to be read by the simulation and 2000 hours is the maximum amount of hours the simulation can run.

Once compiled, follow the onscreen prompts on the console!

The extension saves the cost incurred after a simulation and the current simulation number to be read after the simulation has ended.
