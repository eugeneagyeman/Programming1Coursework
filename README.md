# Programming 1 Coursework - Smart Home
Semester Project for Programming 1 to simulate a smart house system. Awarded 84% Overall

The aim of this coursework was to construct a simple simulation of the energy consumption- and energy generation- of a smart house. In the house are a number of appliances which consume/generate electricity or consume water when they operate, meters that record the amount of water and electricity consumed/generated and a battery which stores excess electricity if the house happens to generate more than it needs.
